        <h3>
          Welcome to Threads Culture. If you are a Manager, Owner or CEO who is
          looking for the real answers on culture, this is the right place.
        </h3>
        <p>
          We created this website because we have been in your shoes before and
          know it is next to impossible to sort through all the bullshit and
          people who want to get you on a $250 per hour treadmill to find the
          stuff that actually works. We went through years of listening to the
          “experts” recommended by our CEO/Owner friends and implementing the
          latest business books of the moment. It was mostly an exercise in
          wasted time.</p>
          <p>We had to learn culture from getting our hands dirty and
          actually figuring out what worked. The information here is based on
          our real experiences leading teams, buying our own companies, starting
          our own companies and providing training to hundreds of organizations
          in every type of industry over the last 25 years.</p>
          <p>Our goal with this site is to teach you everything you need to be a successful real-world
          expert with culture. All of our models, exercises, etc. are free to
          download without giving up your contact info. No calls to action, no
          landing pages, no pay wall, no hourly fees. Those things are about
          money… lead sources, sales pipelines and eventually selling you
          something. For our purposes here, that would cheapen what this is
          actually about.</p>
          <p>So why did we create this site? We know what it feels
          like as a leader to have people on your team genuinely smile, thank
          you and tell you that they can’t imagine having to go work anywhere
          else. We want you to feel this as a leader. We want the people on your
          teams to experience what it is like to work in this kind of
          environment.</p>
          <p>And if you are here now reading this, we know you have
          what it takes to make this happen in your team.</p>
          <p>All of the posts below
          are organized by category if you have a specific area of focus, but
          also in the order we would proceed if you are starting from scratch.</p>
          <p>Before you get started, we recommend that you read these two posts.
          While anyone can have a level of success with what we show you below,
          the deepest, most genuine rewards are available to those who take some
          time to get their hearts and minds right first.</p>

          <br />
           <a href="#">Your Last Day at Work</a>
           <p>After you read these two articles, move
          on to the rest. Lay out a schedule and start implementing these things
          one at a time.</p>
          <p>If you don’t see one of your questions addressed, email
          us here and we will add the content of this site.</p>

              There is a lot of confusion about Culture.  This section will give you a concrete definition of culture and a starting point for where your team or organization can begin.  There is also some strategy on finding the right speed to implement the culture changes you want to make.
